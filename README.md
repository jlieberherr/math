Some mathematical texts

- [Raumgruppenproblem](roomgroups/Raumgruppenproblem.pdf): necessary and sufficient conditions that the demand can be covered by the capacity. Can be used, for example, to ensure that sufficient rooms are available when working with room groups in timetable planning. The proof that the conditions are sufficient uses the max-flow-min-cut theorem. 
- [Schwerpunkt Kegelstumpf](truncated_cone/Schwerpunkt_Kegelstumpf.pdf): Calculation of the center of gravity of the truncated cone.
